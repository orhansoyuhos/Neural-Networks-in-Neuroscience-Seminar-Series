# Neural-Networks-in-Neuroscience-Seminar-Series

The seminar series is an introduction to the basis of deep neural networks and their applications to neuroimaging data.
For our final project, we wrote a short script and used brain data recorded by commercial EEG to predict whether a subject was presented with a number or not.
