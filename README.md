# Neural-Networks-Workshop

The class covered the foundational and practical machine learning skills for building and training artificial deep neural network models for the neuroimaging data.
For our final project, we wrote a short script and used brain data recorded by commercial EEG to predict whether a subject was presented with a number or not.
