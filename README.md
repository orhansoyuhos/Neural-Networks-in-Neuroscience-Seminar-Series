# Neural-Networks-in-Neuroscience-Seminar-Series

This project was part of a seminar series introducing deep neural networks and their applications to neuroimaging data. The primary goal was to develop a short script capable of predicting whether a subject was presented with a number or not, using brain data recorded by commercial EEG devices. By applying deep neural networks to the EEG data, we aimed to create a reliable model for detecting the presentation of numbers to subjects.
